Hi, my name is Matheus, an electronic engineer from Brazil. I've been working in the last few years as a embedded software enginner, developing applications and firmwares in the most diverse areas of electronic. Here in this repository, I leave some projects and codes that I developed for study and learning. Feel free to use it!
